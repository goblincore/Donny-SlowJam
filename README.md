## Slowjam - Slow your roll

Created using React Native and the very cool Expo SDK.
The basic idea of this app is a Youtube music playing application, with a twist - the audio is processed so that it's sl o w w w e d down (both time and pitch). This has the effect of elevating the pathos of certain songs to the next level - for example, try listening to **The Smith's "Heaven knows I'm miserable now"** at 70% speed - it's epically tragicomic. The popularity of slowed-down music probably has it's origins in the pioneering efforts of Robert Earl Davis Jr. (July 20, 1971 â€“ November 16, 2000), better known as DJ Screw, whose "CHOPPED N SCREWED" mixes are a deep and compelling exploration of slowed down music.

## Technical Challenges

This app was created as part of Flex Week in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion Program. The goal is to practice learning a new technology/framework/etc in a week; in this case, I chose React Native.
